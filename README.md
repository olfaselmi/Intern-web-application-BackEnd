# Intern Web Application Backend

This repository hosts the backend code for a web application developed during my internship. It encompasses the necessary API endpoints, business logic, and data models required to support the application's functionality.

## Project Structure

The backend is structured as follows:

- `.mvnw`, `.mvnw.cmd`: Maven wrapper scripts for building and running the project.
- `src`: Source files including controllers, services, repositories, models, etc.
- `.gitattributes`: Git configuration file that affects how certain file types are handled.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `auth.p12`: Authentication certificate (ensure this is secure and not publicly accessible if it's sensitive).
- `pom.xml`: Maven Project Object Model file that contains configurations for the project, including dependencies.

## Getting Started
